Faster Database

currently, sqlite is not good enough to store tile data. it is probably slow for the job.
a custom database format will be written that will store data for tiles.
it will run using node-gyp. the data will be stored in a single file and will
act similarly like a file system using sectors. the dynamic sizes of the tiles
will be a tricky problem to solve. each tile will contain their id, world id, coordinates,
data, properties, and a few other things that are currently stored in the current sqlite
tables. the database will be responsible for caching some tiles to prevent overloading of
the harddrive. the database will primarily be stored in the utf16 format. the main area
of the front page may be cached permanently for speedups. the database must use journaling
to prevent corruptions and must use tests.
