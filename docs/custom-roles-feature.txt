Custom Roles Feature

currently, there only exists 3 roles: Public, Member, and Owner.
this feature would allow an owner of a world to create custom roles, each
having their own permissions. owners can decide to give each role
their own tile protection, or their own set of permissions. they can even
give members permissions to grant permissions, grant roles, or to create more roles.
this would be configurable in the world configuration page.
worlds would be limited to 2048 custom roles as of now in case of technical limitations.
each role will have a unique numeric id that is greater than 2 because
the first 3 basic roles already exist. when a tile is protected to a specific custom role,
it will store the id of the role. when a char is protected using precise char using
custom roles, it will switch to a different format that can store the ids of the roles.
