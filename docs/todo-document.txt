- Binary format
- Refactoring the frontend code : Will it ever be done?
- Make it usable on phones
- UI layout
- Different member categories
- don't use javascript to make the hover color change in the nav, use css :hover
- make menu wider by doing width: 150px; in #nav {...
- the ability to ban
- erase spam from chat
- tile caching in backend to prevent overloading
- when loading color from localstorage, change value in color pciker
- option to enable or disable javascript links
- pressing tab to advance the cursor 4 chars
- look into the fail-safe transaction function - it could be broken
- large scale erasing
- pausing on idle; toggle on menu
- broadcastCommand binary (accept arrays at the moment)
- (worlds) change title of page
- (worlds) change favicon to characters
- when updating world settings, update settings cache in all clients too
- combine sql queries on fetch requests with multiple ranges
- Websockets disconnect every minute unless ping requests are sent (JSON)
- race condition error with visitor counter
- combine edits requests while a tile is locked
- worlds in the /w/ or /-/ namespace will not be claimable, but worlds can be generated on that namespace like normal worlds
- list of clients on world pages
- split fetch requests if requesting too many tiles
- do not receive write updates from far places
- select region to copy
- better crsftoken and csrfmiddlewaretoken utilization
- option to expand buffer size of tiles (rendering on client)
- when clearing public areas, don't allow multiple instances of clearances
- rate limit chat based on ip connections [partially implemented, but bad ip system]
- fix edit signal duplication checking / bulking
- rate limit if sending way too many edits (probably to the point of server slowing down)
- disabling (in options) rendering block characters as a square instead of character
- limit cache invalidation of tiles (on the client) if too many are loaded. the client may fetch tiles 3 times per second if it's out of control
- refactor chat backend file
- when the socket disconnects as tiles were being fetched, they will never be fetched and will remain as dead tiles
- admin clearing tools: filter by area protection, url/coord links, etc...
- links inside telledit
- dos the owot test server to test for dos vunerabilities
- 1 canvas instead of 2

- ourworldoftext.com email domain, if possible at all
- if it's not problematic, restart the server (automatically) if it crashes
- transaction system race condition with write requests (edits can end a transaction while a request started it). probably need a central queue
- /warp to a world on the same socket connection
- Content-Type
- initial typing on the edgy browser will not work unless clicking several times
- DOM rendering mode
- after midnight (12:00 AM), make the theme of a certain page black with blue neon. not sure which page. not sure why.
- if possible, test cases
- when warping to a different world or server, transistions. random one every time. sliding, 3d effects, etc.
- password recovery via email
- prevent receival of updates from areas far from where the client currently is
- logging thousands of errors in a short time will make the server non-responsive due to blocking I/O
- setting to disable chat completely
- select areas to copy or move them somewhere else
- chat ids that range randomly from 10000 - 99999. disconnected clients get cleared out after 30 mins
- invalid world color syntax causes graphical glitches
- any email inputted in the registration form will tell the user that the ver. email has been sent, no matter what the error is
- warning when clicking on urls
- ctrl+click to not click on urls
- when zoomed out, client is slow
- a new chrome update took away the good parts of the client. it kept the bad parts and made it slower. the result is the aftermath of a bad chrome update. too many tile drawcalls slow it down
- multiple custom user roles
- limit 3 combining chars in chat thing
- world owners can delete individual messages in chatbox. admins can delete from global
- .keyCode pending deprecation
- chatbar <input> not stopping if limit exceeds
- owot not working on firefox. dumb browser cannot establish a connection for some reason (turns out to be cloudflare proxy) / port 443 firewall thing
- outdated nginx
- keep up with the times. http2 (and ssl on the server's side (not cloudflare's))
